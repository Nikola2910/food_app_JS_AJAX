***** JS PROJECT HOMEWORK *****


WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ?

TASK 1:

Add fields for calories range (min and max calories), as per API documentation.

TASK 2:

Each time when you fetch results you get 10 results by default, as well as info how many results in total there are. 

Add pagination, so in the bottom of the page you have results pages like:

1 2 3 4 5 etc.

When you switch to some other page you should send request and get results for that page.

Check API documentation in order to find out how to get range of results (from and to).
